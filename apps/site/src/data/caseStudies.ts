      'Identified the cost of running two frontend frameworks in parallel and drove the decision to consolidate fully on React.',
    narrative: [
      'The codebase had grown to run both Vue and React side by side, splitting frontend knowledge across the team and duplicating tooling, patterns, and review effort.',
      'I proposed consolidating on React, got buy-in, and led the migration as the main implementer — porting views, untangling shared state, and setting the conventions the codebase uses going forward, with the team contributing alongside me.',
      'The result is a single frontend stack: faster onboarding, one set of patterns to review against, and no more context-switching between two frameworks on the same feature.',

    narrative: [
      'Small-to-medium tickets lose a disproportionate amount of time to process — triage, assignment, implementation, then the PR itself. The goal is to compress that into effectively one click.',
      'A human assigns the bot to a Jira ticket; it triages and comments on the ticket, implements the change, and opens a complete pull request. Standard CI (tests, linting) runs on the PR like any other, and the bot keeps responding to review comments until a human approves and merges.',
